      <description>It’s been 5 years since I graduated high school. There were about 1,200 students in total when I left, and I graduated with 286 other young adults eager to do something with our lives. If facebook is any indicator, that something was to get married and/or have kids as soon as possible. It’s eastern Idaho; what can you expect?
