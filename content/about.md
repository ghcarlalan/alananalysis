I'm great at two things: making jokes and making graphs. This site is for my jokes.

Clearly.

Growing up on a small, isolated, Idahoan farm is a challenge. A challenge I've never had to face thankfully. And while I did grow up in Idaho, I have no more knowledge of potatoes than the next person (FYI it's called the gem state, not the potato state). I've been a few places, gotten a few degrees, and had a few experiences worth converting into visually appealing graphs. In general, I'm just a guy who's trying to get by like anyone else. Currently, I'm living in Salt Lake City getting paid to make *even more* graphs as a Business Intelligence Analyst. In addition to that, I have a short list of "five minute fame" moments that I take more pride in than my Master's degree:

* A [Business Insider list](http://www.businessinsider.com/lulu-funniest-guys-in-every-state-2015-5) for being the funniest guy in Idaho
* This [Tweet](http://thechive.com/2016/07/05/tweets-that-perfectly-explain-how-god-created-specific-animals-30-photos/) featured on The Chive
* Highest rated [post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/8sicso/you_can_picture_their_smiles/) on July 20, 2018 (super wholesome)

I started this site as a project to visualize thoughts I have about who I am, what I do, and what anyone else does. If anything, it's more of a live journal with actual graphics instead of doodles. Either way, I try to put a humorous spin on the overall outlook of whatever is going on (just remember: humor goes both ways). If you want more snippets of my hilarity but with less graphs, follow [me on twitter](http://twitter.com/LikeAlwaysWrong).
