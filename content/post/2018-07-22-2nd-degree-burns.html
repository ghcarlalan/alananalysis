<p>Now that I’ve graduated college for the second time, I’ve moved on to a job that really doesn’t have anything to do with what I studied. Out of the team I’m currently a part of, almost everyone else has formal experience/knowledge/degrees in statistics, math, psychology, etc. As such, some people ask me what I studied (BBA Finance/Management &amp; MS Finance) and what those degrees entail. And while it’s only been a few months since I traded my classes for meetings, I really can’t remember the overall picture – only specific projects or presentations. Which begs the question: what the Hell did I spend the last five years on?</p>

<i>It couldn’t have <strong>all</strong> been spent on wasting paper</i>
</p>
<p>Anyway, for more of my sake than yours, we’re going to walk through my college careers one semester at a time with a fun visual using <strong>interactive</strong> sunburst charts! But before that, it’ll probably help to know where I actually went to college:</p>

<p>Since I lived in Idaho Falls, I figured I’d spend a year starting classes close to home (but more importantly, to score free meals from my parents). After that year, I did the rest of my undergrad an hour South in Pocatello and ISU’s main campus. After that was done, I immediately changed my orange outfits for red ones as I went The U to do my Master’s degree.</p>

<i>“Sellout.” - ISU, probably</i>
</p>
<p>Now that the road map has been laid out, let’s get to why you’re here: fun visuals about underwhelming information!</p>

<p>The way these charts work is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Level: Semester I was in</li>
<li>Second Level: Subject I studied</li>
<li>Third Level: Actual class I took</li>
<li>The percent/count is how many credits it was out of the total credits displayed</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I know it seems like I only took Gen Eds my first semester, but I can explain. I was going to be a Nuclear Engineer when I started college, until I realized that science was <strong>fucking nooooot</strong> my specialty. I got a 2.96 GPA that semester, which almost lost me my scholarship at the time. It was a rough time in general; I was working graveyard shifts that kept me from friends, the people at the satellite campus I went to were much older (and uninterested in making friends), and I was stressed about not being good at what I was studying.</p>
<p>That being said, I lucked out that Chemistry &amp; Calculus counted as Gen Eds, so my efforts weren’t totally wasted as I switched to business.</p>

<p>My second semester I “technically” switched to business, a decision I made after thinking “huh, I relatively enjoy the work I do as a night auditor at this hotel. I’ll look into getting a degree in numbers.” I say technically because I only took one class that wasn’t a Gen Ed again, which was Business Statistics. BUT, true believer, that class showed me what it meant to enjoy your work: I spent 9 hours doing a final project analyzing the statistical differences between housing prices in two nearby cities, and it was actually fun! I remember those hours flying by, and thinking that I might have found my passion/calling/purpose/etc.</p>

<p>My third semester I finally got into actual business courses. I learned my overall love/hate relationship with accounting, got a little bit of law experience, general business knowledge, and advanced business stats. I hadn’t <em>quite</em> figured I wanted to do finance yet, but I was slowly getting there.</p>

<p>My fourth semester is where I started to really take off. I was finding my niche of developing visuals and projects for class that would impress students and professors alike. That pink sliver you see? I did a project in that class that would make me a guest lecturer on the subject of visualization in MS Excel for the next 2 years.</p>

<p>Here I take my first finance class and I fall in love. It made so much sense and offered itself to so much opportunity to make beautiful analysis, imagery, and recommendations. But I knew that Finance majors were a dime a dozen, so I picked up a double major in Management to set myself apart and round off my skillset to be able to understand interacting within an organization, which I also thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>I doubled down on Finance and quickly emerged as one of more passionate students around the subject. I joined the business college’s Finance Club and secured an officer position on it. This led to participating in an intercollegiate competition where I got to explore all of the topics I had been learning but in a real world scenario.</p>

<p>This one was probably my favorite semester. I was co-president of the Finance Club, which led to organizing several fun events and coordinating a volunteer weekend. My classes were a blast because Real Estate Finance was a perfect class to show off my presentation skills, group projects were so much fun because I had enough social capital that people wanted me on their group more often than they didn’t, and in general I just felt like I was a respected/valued member of the college of business.</p>

<p>In contrast, my last semester was tying up loose ends to graduate, which explains the delayed accounting courses and my last remaining Gen Ed. Data Visualization was fun enough, and set up a bit of what I do now. Policy &amp; Management was the capstone course that goes into analyzing/implementing business theory in the real world, and <em>that</em> was a great class.</p>
<p>And that wraps up my bachelor’s degree. You’ll notice there’s actually not a ton of finance classes, which is why I wanted to get my Master’s in the first place. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed my time at ISU, and was honored beyond belief when I was named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzgll650eVo&amp;t=18s">“Outstanding Student in Finance”</a> for my graduating class.</p>

<p>And now we transfer to The U, where everything I had built up back in Pocatello <em>did not matter in the fucking slightest</em>. Not only was I in the minority of coming straight from an undergrad degree, other students had been at The U long enough to already establish relationships with professors and faculty. It took four years to get to the top, and there was no way I was even getting close to that in only one year.</p>
<p>Regardless, I guess I was interested in information systems courses since I had pretty much peaked with MS Office. I had exhausted Excel and PowerPoint’s capabilities, and I ran circles around any other presentation that I came across.</p>

<p>My final semester of college I swapped the data classes for real estate classes for several reasons: data classes were full, I like real estate as a subject I suppose, I was part of an extracurricular real estate competition, etc. Those were fine enough, but, unfortunately, this would be the semester that almost killed me.</p>
<p>I failed my first exam in my life. Not the whole “oh I got a B- what a failure” but an actual 50%. On an exam worth a large part of my grade. Lowest in the class. A <em>finance</em> class. I studied, paid attention, and otherwise was prepared. And while, I didn’t feel great after the test, I never would have thought I would do that bad. I would continue to underperform in other classes, and it really shook my self-confidence. Strike that, it destroyed my self-confidence. What if this entire time I wasn’t actually good at finance, and I just had an easy time. Have I really earned my degrees? What hope do I have of doing well in the real world? How can I say I’m good at this subject if I’m barely passing these classes?</p>
<p>Needless to say, this spawned an existential crisis that would echo and ruin pretty much every aspect of my life, and I’m still dealing with the fallout.</p>

<p>So that about sums it up. If you look at the overall picture of my university acquired knowledge, you can see what my degrees amount to:</p>

<p>Ironically, without my Master’s my finance classes would be underrepresented compared to my other business ones. But at least now I can prove a majority of my knowledge is finance based, which will certainly help me in the future as I deal with large purchases, and making sure I don’t spend all of my money irresponsibly.</p>
